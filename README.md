<p align="center">A simple Discord bot that automatically generates Science Bowl rounds using the ScibowlDB API!</p>

## Deployment
Deploying this bot to your Discord server is relatively simple: you can add it to your own server by using [this link](http://scibot.adawesome.tech/).

## Contributing
Please see [the wiki](https://github.com/ADawesomeguy/AwesomeSciBo/wiki/contributing) contributing page.


## Installation
Please see [the wiki](https://github.com/ADawesomeguy/AwesomeSciBo/wiki/installation) install page.

## Usage
To get started, run the command `do be helping` to get a list of commands. The more helpful commands will be the ones that generate packets, which are `do be roundgen pdf/html` and `do be roundgen pdf/html dm`.

> Note: if you plan to use PDF files, you must have `gotenberg` installed and running at `localhost:3136` (or change the `awesomescibo.mjs` script to point to a different location). You can find more info about that [here](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/gotenberg).

## Notes
### Creating a Discord Application/Bot
To create your own application and bot using the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers), go to the previous link and sign in. Then create a new application, and click bots on the left. Configure it to your liking, and then copy the token.

That's the most important part of your bot *and don't share it with anyone*.

## Credit
The bot was made by [@ADawesomeguy](https://github.com/ADawesomeguy). However, the API was made by [@CQCumbers](https://github.com/CQCumbers). Go give [his API](https://github.com/CQCumbers/ScibowlDB) a star, he totally deserves it!
